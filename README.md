This is a simple DMX usb to serial connector and also arduino hooks. I am working on the queueing system right now but feel free to play with it.
I have tested with a nano arduino and a usb to serial DMX 512 controller (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WLJWVY2)
There will need to be some improvements on comments on modularity but this is train of thought and mock up coding now
I have included the sketch code also for the Nano. So far there has been no latency testing with my setup.
